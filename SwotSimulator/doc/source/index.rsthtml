Welcome to The SWOT Simulator for Ocean Science documentation
=============================================================

This software simulates SWOT observations of sea surface height (SSH) that can be applied to an ocean general circulation model (OGCM), allowing the exploration of ideas and methods to optimize information retrieval from the SWOT Mission in the future. From OGCM SSH inputs, the software generates SWOT-like outputs on a swath along the orbit ground track and adds measurement error and noise, which are generated according to technical characteristics published by the SWOT project team.
